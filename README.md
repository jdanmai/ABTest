# ABTest
AB Page Tests Results

This project is an analysis using Python done on Jupyter notebooks.

I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

There are several parts to this project
I- Probability
II- A/B Test
III- A Regression Approach
III- Results of Finding
